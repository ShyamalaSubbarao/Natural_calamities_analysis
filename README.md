# Natural_calamities_analysis

# 1) What is planned to be built

  A machine learning or a deep learning model that can forecast, when a natural disaster is likely to occur by learning from the past situations. Forecasting natural disasters can be very useful because it can help in saving lives and sufficient precautionary measures can be taken.  

# 2) How does the prototype work
  
  Different factors should be taken into account for predicting a natural disaster. For instance, to predict if there would be rainfall, factors like temperature, air current, weather conditions, humidity, geographical location, pressure, precipitation and climatic conditions in the immediate past are taken into consideration. When the rainfall amount eventually crosses a threshold, it can further lead to a landslide or can result in flood.
  Tsunamis and earthquakes can be detected by changes in tectonic plate movements, seismic waves variations, unusual behaviors by animals and birds, the geographical location of the place, wind speed, air pressure etc. These factors act as the input features and helps in predicting if a natural calamity is likely to occur.

# 3) How users can get started with the project
  
  To get started the various input features and their dependency with the output is observed and the most important features are filtered out. Feature engineering will be done for the data followed by feature selection or feature reduction. Also the distribution of the datasets will be studied to come up with the right learning algorithm or any ensemble model. Any skews, outliers and variance are analyzed. Once data preprocessing is done the models are trained and predictions can be made.

# 4) what datasets are you using 
  
  Datasets from kaggle, UCI repository and other datasets that will be used, is available in the link below.

# 5) Technologies used
   Rstudio or python libraries will be used for data processing, building the models and for data visualization. For achieving a better performance parallelisation will be done or any cluster computing technology like spark will be used.
